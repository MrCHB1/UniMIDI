# UniMIDI
A Console MIDI Player (soon to be a OpenGL MIDI Player)

### How to run
First of all, open your terminal and move your directory to the same location as "UniMIDI.csproj"
If you have .NET Runtime installed (Core 3.1 is recommended, but you can also give .NET 5 a go), go ahead and type this command in the console:

```dotnet run [path/to/midifile.mid] <noColor>```

- `[]` is required
- `<>` is optional

UniMIDI will simply visualize the notes played as time progresses. (Audio is not yet implemented (on Linux))
