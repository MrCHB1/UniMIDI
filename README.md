# UniMIDI
A Console MIDI Player (soon to be a OpenGL MIDI Player)

### How to run
First of all, open your terminal and move your directory to the same location as "UniMIDI.csproj"
If you're on the Linux platform, go ahead and type this command in the console:

```dotnet run path/to/midifile.mid```

If you're on Windows, you should already know how to run .csproj files through the console. If not, try looking up how to do this.

UniMIDI will simply visualize the notes played as time progresses. (Audio is not yet implemented)
